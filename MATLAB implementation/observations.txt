- u chatters
- decreasing gamma decreases rate and thus u does not saturate
- if u does not saturate the i/p constraints may be used but add no value
- clf works by itself
- using velocity helps in bound constraints because the state higher order terms do not increase to large amounts
  and thus when they come near the boundaries they are controllable
- increasing R may be a solution to chattering
